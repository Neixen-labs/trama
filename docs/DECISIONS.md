# Decisions

## 2026-08-09 — Business Source License 1.1 for the core

**Decision:** License TRAMA version `0.0.0-pre-alpha` under BSL 1.1, with Carlos Guerrero as Licensor. Production use is permitted only for internal business operations. Offering TRAMA, or a substantially similar hosted or managed service, to third parties requires a commercial license.

**Change date:** 2030-08-09, when this version converts to Apache-2.0.

**Why:** Keep source visible and permit evaluation, contribution, and internal adoption without allowing an unlicensed hosted competitor during the initial commercial phase.

**Consequence:** TRAMA is source-available, not OSI open source. New released versions must carry their own BSL change date. External contributions require the Individual Contributor License Agreement so the Licensor can relicense future versions.

## 2026-08-09 — Tile-local 16-bit geometry coordinates

**Decision:** Store v0 geometry positions as unsigned 16-bit normalized coordinates relative to each tile extent.

**Why:** This halves geometry coordinate storage versus `f32`, is GPU-friendly, and preserves controllable local precision. At a 10 km tile width, one quantization step is about 15 cm.

**Consequence:** Each tile must declare its extent. Exact engineering values remain typed properties; they are not recovered from quantized render geometry.

## 2026-08-09 — Zstandard compression per section

**Decision:** Compress each v0 section independently with Zstandard (zstd).

**Why:** Independent compression preserves HTTP range loading while providing a strong size/speed trade-off for binary geometry and graph buffers.

**Consequence:** Readers need a zstd decoder; the browser engine will ship or load a small WASM decoder. v0 does not support mixed compression codecs.

## 2026-08-10 — Line geometry ships centerlines, not a mesh

**Decision:** A writer does not tessellate line geometry. For a tile whose paths are all lines, `mesh_vertex_count` and `mesh_index_count` are zero and the renderer builds the ribbon from consecutive `PathVertex` pairs on the GPU. The mesh fields stay for geometry that needs real triangulation.

**Why:** `MeshVertex` records a position and an edge, not a side of the centerline, so it cannot express a ribbon of constant screen-space width. The alternatives were to widen the vertex with a side flag and a quantized normal, or to bake thickness in world units. The first costs roughly four times the vertices of the path array on line-heavy data; the second makes a line vanish when zooming out and forces a recompile to restyle.

**Consequence:** Pillar 1's "pre-tessellated, ready for `bufferData`" holds for polygons but not for lines, where the file ships centerlines and the GPU reconstructs the ribbon. Stroke width becomes a camera-time and style-time decision. The engine owes a line renderer that instances quads from `PathVertex`; a reader must accept a zero mesh as valid.

## 2026-08-10 — The reference solver speaks HTTP and Server-Sent Events, not WASM

**Decision:** Implement the first solver, `solvers/example-diffusion`, as an HTTP server streaming packed deltas over Server-Sent Events. The WASM/WASI runtime the contract also allows comes later.

**Why:** Both transports must produce the same 18-byte delta, so the contract can only be proven by an implementation that exercises the parts a mock cannot: a stream that arrives in arbitrary chunks, an error raised mid-solve, and a client that must reject a stream ending without its completion event. A WASM module returning a buffer in one piece exercises none of those. The server also runs unchanged in the tests, so the suite talks to real sockets rather than to a fake of the protocol.

**Consequence:** The engine's solver client is written against a stream, which is the harder of the two shapes; a WASM runtime can hand it the same bytes without changing it. Nothing yet proves the sandboxed path, and no solver is isolated from the host — an HTTP solver is trusted code at the other end of a socket. The event framing is now load-bearing and belongs in `docs/SOLVER_CONTRACT.md`, not in the example's source.

## 2026-08-11 — Node identity comes from the geometry grid

**Decision:** When a source does not name its nodes, a writer derives node identity from the section 3.1 quantization cell, expressed globally as `tile * extent + q`, instead of comparing coordinates for equality. Recorded in SPEC 4.1.

**Why:** Identity by exact float equality means two features share a node only when their coordinates are bit-identical. Shared vertices written by different tools, or round-tripped through different precisions, routinely differ in their last digits, and the result is a graph torn into fragments whose geometry still draws perfectly — the failure is invisible to rendering and only surfaces when a solver traverses topology. The alternative, snapping within a tolerance, is what GIS tools do, but it puts a dataset-dependent number in the middle of topology: too large and it silently merges genuinely distinct nodes. The grid needs no tuning because it is the precision the file already stores.

**Consequence:** Topology is fixed at about 4 cm at the equator at `z14`, and two nodes closer than one cell become one node; a source needing finer topology must name its nodes. Node IDs derived from position change with this decision, so existing containers do not compare equal to a recompilation of their source. Quantization is now load-bearing for identity as well as for rendering, so a future change to `extent` or to the tile zoom would renumber every unnamed node. A `--node-tolerance` escape hatch stays available if a real dataset needs one.
