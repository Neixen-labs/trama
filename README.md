**Open network-map engine for people who do not use GIS.**

TRAMA packages a network graph, pre-tessellated geometry, and typed properties into one portable binary file. It renders network state on the GPU across time and runs analysis through open solver plugins—locally or on a server. The core stays domain-agnostic: it knows nodes, edges, properties, and state channels, not pipes, roads, or power lines.

## The three pillars

- **Open binary format** — range-request friendly, offline-capable, and exportable to GeoJSON, GeoPackage, and MVT.
- **GPU rendering with time** — WebGPU with WebGL2 fallback, GPU state textures, temporal scrub, and network fly-through.
- **Open solver contract** — sandboxed WASM/WASI or server solvers with the same state-delta protocol; EPANET is first.

## Status

**Pre-alpha. Specification in progress.**
